## Project: ShariotExplorer by sam

Shariot provides A-A car-sharing services in Singapore.
Shariot Explorer is a personal project (with no affiliation with Shariot) that was developed to help Shariot users view all the vehicles available at a glance.
At time of writing, it is impossible for Shariot users to view all the vehicles being offered, therefore, this website provides a convenient way to view the cars available, and their location.
It also allows users to sort/filter the vehicles by their location region, and even find the nearest Shariot location near them!

Shariot was launched on Christmas Eve (24 December 2020) and gained close to 800 views over the following two days. It is currently being maintained for further exciting features!

## Project: NUS Carparks
NUS Carparks was a project developed under NUS Orbital (CP2106) Programme.
As someone who drives to school occasionally, I found it difficult to locate carparks that were near my destination.
Therefore, I came up with the idea of NUS Carparks.
NUS Carparks allows you to find the nearest carpark to your building with just a simple search.
It also shows you useful analytics of the carpark, such as crowd levels, so you could plan your trip and find a parking lot!

Together with Teck Heng, we developed it under the NUS Orbital Programme, which is a summer self-directed and independent work course.
I handled the Telegram Bot and Web Application while Teck Heng handled the analytics. Do feel free to give it a try!
