#### 4.2.1 Command Format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

This section details the format of the commands available in TutorBuddy. We will adhere to the following:


* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add_student n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `find_student KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` can be used as `find_student John Samuel` or as `find_student John`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/98765432 p/99999999`, only `p/99999999` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `emails`, `help`, `exit`, `clear` and `list`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Indexes **must be positive whole numbers** 1, 2, 3, â€¦

* The `STUDENT_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the [displayed student list](#application-overview).

* The `SESSION_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the [displayed session list](#application-overview).

* Time must be input in the format, `hh:mm`.
  e.g. `13:00` is allowed, but not `1300`.
  
* Date must be input in the format, `yyyy-mm-dd`.
  e.g. `2021-01-01` is allowed, but not `01-01-2021`.
